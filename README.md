# typelevel-nix

In antiquity, installing [sbt] was sufficient to compile, test, and run most Scala projects.  sbt would fetch all your JVM dependencies, and you didn't have other dependencies.  There was a [Scala CLR] target, but it was abandoned.

Years passed, and [Scala.js] was born, and we were back to crossing platforms.  We suddenly needed a [Node] installation to run our tests.  More libraries are supporting [Scala Native].  Static site generators outside our JVM bubble have come and gone.

"Faugh," you say.  "The JVM is good enough for me".  Fine, but your libraries target Java 8 for broad appeal and your applications target Java 17 because it's 9 bigger, and you have to juggle multiple JVMs.

Wouldn't it be nice to have one-stop shopping for your development environment again?

## `nix develop` to the rescue

Enter the [Nix] package manager.  We can use [nix develop] to get a full, build enviroment for modern, cross-platform Scala.

For now, you'll need at least Nix 2.4 and to enable the [Nix command].

### The baseline

```console
$ java -version
bash: java: command not found
$ sbt -version
bash: sbt: command not found
$ node --version
bash: node: command not found
```

All my apes gone.

### Library shell

The one-liner `nix develop github:rossabaker/typelevel-nix#library` gets us a full environment:

```console
$ nix develop github:rossabaker/typelevel-nix#library
ðŸ”¨ Welcome to typelevel-lib-shell

[general commands]

  menu      - prints this menu
  sbt       - A build tool for Scala, Java and more
  scala-cli - Command-line tool to interact with the Scala language

[versions]

  Java - 8.0.292
  Node - 16.13.1

$ sbt -version
sbt version in this project: 1.6.1
sbt script version: 1.6.1
$ exit
```

### Application shell

Alternatively, `nix develop github:rossabaker/typelevel-nix#application` gives us the same, with a more contemporary JDK:

```console
$ nix develop github:rossabaker/typelevel-nix#application
ðŸ”¨ Welcome to typelevel-app-shell

[general commands]

  menu      - prints this menu
  sbt       - A build tool for Scala, Java and more
  scala-cli - Command-line tool to interact with the Scala language

[versions]

  Java - 17.0.1
  Node - 16.13.1

$ sbt -version
sbt version in this project: 1.6.1
sbt script version: 1.6.1
$ exit
```

## Infrequently asked questions

### Is this stable?

Not yet, but flake.lock makes it reproducible.

###	Can I use it with trusty old `nix-shell`?

Absolutely! The `shell.nix` provides a flakes-compatible shell that works with `nix-shell`. It selects the `application` shell by default, but you can be specific about it. E.g.

```
$ nix-shell --argstr shell library
```

To use it remotely, copy the content of the `shell.nix` in your project and point `src` to this repository instead. E.g.

```nix
{
  src = fetchTarball {
    url = "https://github.com/rossabaker/typelevel-nix/archive/main.tar.gz";
    sha256 = "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"; # replace hash
  };
};
```

### What if my library or app requires Java 11?

Uh, we'll expose a library function or something soon.

### Can I embed this in a project to share with my colleagues and collaborators?

Yes.  You should be able to put a `flake.nix` so you can share with your colleagues or open source collaborators, and even provide a [direnv] so your `$SHELL` and `$EDITOR` do the right thing.  Examples forthcoming.

### Does it handle site generators like Jekyll?

Not yet, but it would be great to make that easier.  I've grown fond of [Laika], which doesn't require any of this.

### Is this a Typelevel project?

It's built with Typelevel projects in mind, but this is an individual experiment right now.  If received well, I'll transfer it.
